        <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By using the Fox Utilities Discord bot ("the Bot"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("ToS").
            If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Bot.</p>

        <h2>Description of Service</h2>
        <p>The Bot provides various functions within Discord, as described in its documentation. We reserve the right to
            modify, suspend, or discontinue the Bot at any time without notice.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Bot is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Bot will
            be error-free, uninterrupted, secure, or that it will meet your specific needs. We disclaim any
            responsibility for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by the use or inability to use the Bot.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
            special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly
            or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your
            access to or use of or inability to access or use the Bot; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on
            Discord; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.</p>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses,
            including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of
            the Bot, your violation of these ToS, or your violation of any rights of another user.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may revise these ToS at any time by posting the updated terms on the Bot's Discord server or other
            relevant channels. Your continued use of the Bot after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the
            new ToS.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Bot immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
            reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these ToS. All provisions of these ToS which
            by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation,
            ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These ToS shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Virginia,
            without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about these ToS, please contact us at our <a href="https://discord.gg/ZVJasmz">Discord server</a>.</p>
