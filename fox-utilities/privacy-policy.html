        <h1>Privacy Policy for Fox Utilities</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
            We are committed to protecting your privacy while using our
            Discord bot. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and
            use information within the bot's operation.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Error Logging:</b> To ensure the bot functions correctly,
            we log command errors for debugging purposes. These logs
            capture the specific command that caused the error but do
            not include your name, the server name, or any other
            personally identifiable information.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Data Persistence:</b> Our bot does not use databases or
            other persistent storage mechanisms to retain user
            information. The exception is the error logging mentioned
            above, which is temporary and used solely for
            troubleshooting.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Misuse Policy:</b> We strictly adhere to the principle of
            data minimization. We will never use the bot to access,
            collect, store, or share any information beyond what is
            explicitly described in this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>

        <p>
            While we do not store personally identifiable information,
            we take reasonable precautions to protect the error logs
            from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
            destruction.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>
            Our bot may interact with third-party services (such as
            Discord's API) to provide functionality. These services have
            their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review
            them. We are not responsible for their data practices.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>

        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will
            notify you of any significant changes through the bot's
            Discord server or other appropriate channels.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>

        <p>
            You have the right to request access to any error logs
            containing your commands. You can also request that we
            delete these logs. Please contact us using the information
            below.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>

        <p>
            If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy
            Policy or the bot's data practices, please contact us at our
            <a href="https://discord.gg/ZVJasmz">Discord server</a>.
        </p>

        <p><b>Effective Date:</b> 7/18/2024</p>

        <hr/>
        <p>
            <b>Important Notes:</b><br />
            This policy is in addition to, and does not replace,
            Discord's own privacy policy.<br />
            Our bot is not intended for children under the age of 13. We
            do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
